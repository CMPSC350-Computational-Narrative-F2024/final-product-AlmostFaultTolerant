# CMPSC 350: Project Plan

## Summary  

My plan is to generate 15-20 images using both llamma and gpt(30-50 total) for 2 reasons: first, to try to get each image to be as close as possible to its opposite version on the other model and second, to try to construct a comic using a back-and-forth strategy. By this I mean, the first image is gpt, second is llama, going back and forth and constructing a narrative in the comic that makes sense and has a similar style. I plan to use chain prompting, mostly no-shot but some few shot prompts, and the software we used to put the comic into a pdf after generation.

## Peer works

The biggest inspiration is project2, as both of the final products is a comic book pdf consisting of AI generated images. Secondly, the prompt chaining reading we covered in week 9 will contribute heaviliy to this project, as prompt chaining will be used often to make the mirror images as similar as possible. Finally, the Dalle E Image Generation classwork will help due to the different contexts we learned how to use in class like infographic, comic, painting, etc. I think my knowledge on adding more context to my prompt will contribute to this project

## Challenges

I expect the largest challenges in this project to be image inconsistency based on art style and characters. Even when using the same model, people's features will change often, so it'll take very descriptive prompts to keep those two consistent.
