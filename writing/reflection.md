# CMPSC 350: Final Reflection

## Final title

The Pet Rock's Adventures

## Summary

My work is a comic made using a back-and-forth method of rotating between 2 different image generation AI's(dalle and ImageFX). The goal of the project is to tell a coherent story without words despite using two very different image generation tools.

## Reference works

1) Project 2 was my main source of inspiration from this project, as I had a lot of fun trying prompt chaining and different commands in order to produce very specific images to tell a story. I decided to increase the difficulty by using an image generation tool I wasn't familiar with, so not only more than 1 image generation tool but also the 2nd one was new to me for this project.

2) The Infographic spreadsheet we did was very useful for reference for this project. It was the classwork we did where we made a variety of different categories of image such as infographics, diagrams, paintings and more. It helped me further customize my prompts beyond color and art style. For instance, I rotated most of this project between a comic and a minimalistist drawing in terms of category of image, with cartoon also being used once or twice.

3) Prompt 6 where we covered story structure doesn't directly relate to my project, since I didn't directly use any of those story structures. However, I got inspiration from them and made a story using what I knew about story structure from this work.


## Describe your single largest success.

To manage to create a fairly coherent story using two very different image generators.

## Describe your single largest challenge or failure.

The limitations of ImageFX was by far my biggest challenge in the project. It's much more limited compared to the image generation tools we've used in class, and even edits your prompt to only take the keywords.

## The role of feedback

TODO: Describe how the feedback from peers shaped your work. This can incorporate feedback
from earlier assignments or solely from this one. Cite at least two (2) examples, though
more are always more helpful.

## Contextualizing

TODO: This course asked you to understand language as technology and information for carrying,
permuting, combining, destroying, and altering ideas. How does your work fit into your understanding
of the course? If there's one final take-away from participating in creative diversion/adventure into
technology, narrative, and meaning, what is it and how did it factor into this longform work?
