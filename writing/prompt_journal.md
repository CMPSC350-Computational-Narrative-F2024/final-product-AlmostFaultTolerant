1)
generate an image of a stick figure on brown ground with a blue background holding the leash of his pet rock. Use minimalist art and limited palette colors.
3)
so now generate an image with the same artstyle and setting and color palette as before, this time hopping along to the left, still smiling. Make it midair in the picture and that it's obviously moving.

no, it needs to be the same art style as the first image, minimalist and not well drawn. Also, its supposed to be just the rock hopping to the left with a leash on but nobody holding the leash.

generate an image with a flat brown ground with very little detail as well as a blue background also with no detail. The ground should begin about halfway up the image, and on top of the ground should be a poorly drawn rock with a smiley face with a leash attached to it but no one holding the leash and its hopping to the left in mid air. Very minimalist art style and only use two colors, brown and blue

generate an image with the same art style and color paleete with a flat brown ground with very little detail as well as a blue background also with no detail. The ground should begin about halfway up the image, and on top of the ground should be a poorly drawn rock with a smiley face with a leash attached to it that it being held by a floating white circle with a deadpan. They are both going to the left and they see a large tree, so large that only the trunk fits in the image

The ground and background are correct, and there is a tree, but it needs some fixing. For one, the leash is being held by a floating white circle with a deadpan facial expression, and they are both looking at large tree trunk to their left

a brown rock with a smiley face that is on top of a brown ground with a blue background . The rock is on the right half of the image and has a leash on with no one holding it. Do it in a very minimalistic style , like a child using a marker to draw.

a brown rock with a smiley face that is on top of a brown ground with a blue background . The rock is on the right half of the image and has a leash on with no one holding it. Do it in a very minimalistic style, like a child using a marker to draw. It needs to be a messy image, with the colors not completely being on top of what they should color. Like the rock should be brown but a little bit of brown should be outside of it.

The ground should begin about halfway up the image, and on top of the ground is a rock with a leash attached to it but no one holding the leash . He should be in the middle of the image with the leash to the right, and he should be smiling at a white circle floating in the air that has a deadpan. Make this all very minimalistic and not high quality.
