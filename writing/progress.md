# CMPSC 350: Project Progress

## Provide a tentative title for the work.

The Pet Rock's Adventure

## Description

TODO: Provide a 3-5 sentence description of your progress to this point. What has been
difficult? What has been enjoyable? Has your concept changed or shifted in any meaningful way?
I've decided to use ImageFX by Google instead of Llama to mix up the project more beyond what was already done in previous classwork. 

## Peer Feedback

TODO: Identify at least 3 questions to pose to an in-class peer. 

### Unstructured peer feedback



## Persisting challenges

The largest challenge I had during the project with the inconsistencies of the two different image generators. Especially being specific with ImageFX, getting specific generated images is very difficult with it. I often had to adapt the narrative to what was generated without being asked for.

Another problem I had with this project was the difference in image sizes. I also decided to adapt to the sizing changes to the last group of images I decided on.
