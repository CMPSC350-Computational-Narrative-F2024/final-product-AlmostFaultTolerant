# CMPSC 350: Project Progress

## Provide a tentative title for the work.

The Pet Rock's Adventure

## Description

I've made some serious progress in my project, coming up with around 10 images that I think I'll use in my final project. There's been some serious accuracy problems with ImageFX, but its enjoyable trying to find ways to work around the limited prompting techniques that work on it. The only change I've made is to use ImageFX for more variety and to set it apart from other projects we've done.

## Persisting challenges

The largest challenge I had during the project with the inconsistencies of the two different image generators. Especially being specific with ImageFX, getting specific generated images is very difficult with it. I often had to adapt the narrative to what was generated without being asked for.

Another problem I had with this project was the difference in image sizes. I also decided to adapt to the sizing changes to the last group of images I decided on.
